# Macro Opener

This is a macro opener for **Bee Swarm Simulator**.

## How to Use

1. **Make a Discord bot** at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)  
   - Make sure the bot has **Message Content Intent** on.  
   - Invite it to at least one server (to be safe).

2. **Open Macro Opener** and input your Discord bot token.

3. **Input your user ID**  
   How to get your user ID:  
   - Enable **Developer Mode** on Discord  
   - Right-click your profile and click **Copy ID**

4. **Set a command trigger**  
   - Suggested: `!OM` (you can use anything!)

5. **Upload your macro**  
   - Click **Browse** and choose your macro (Revo has been tested, Natro has not).

6. **Choose GUI options**  
   - You can choose to have the GUI open on startup, the bot start automatically, or neither. Both can be turned on/off later.

7. **Start/Stop the bot!** 🎉
